## [Introduction to Tensorflow](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Introduction_to_Tensorflow.ipynb)
In this file there is a simple introduction to Tensorflow. Introduction to tensors their properties and basic operation to be applied on them.

## [Core Algoritms](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/Core%20Algorithms)
#### [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Core%20Algorithms/Linear_Regression.ipynb)
In this task we use Titanic dataset to find the likelhood of a person to survive giving some inforamtion about them.

#### [Classification](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Core%20Algorithms/Classification.ipynb)
In this task we use Iris Flower dataset to predict the species of a flower giving some details about it.

#### [Clustering](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Core%20Algorithms/Clustering.ipynb)
In this file we can find a simple explination about Clustering and K-Means algorithm.

#### [Hidden Markov Models](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Core%20Algorithms/Hidden_Markov_Models.ipynb)
In this file, Hidden Markov Models are simply explained and then an example was developed.
The task was to build a weather model that can predict the weather on any given day, given the probability of different events occuring.

## [Neural Networks](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Neural_Network.ipynb)
In this file, there is a simple explination about the basics of a neural network. Moreover, there is an example of building a neural network to predict the content of an image based on the Fashion MNIST dataset from Keras.

## [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb)
In this file, there is an explination about the basics of a convolutional neural network, and its architecture. Moreover, there is an example of building a convolutional neural network to predict the class of an image on the CIAFR dataset from Keras. 
In addition, there is an explaination about augmentation the datasets, and about using a pretrained model in order to deal with small datasets. Moreover, a model based on a pretrained model from tensorflow was built to distinguish dogs from cats images. The dataset used is provided from Tensorflow.

## [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing)
### [Introduction](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/NLP_BagOfWords.ipynb)
In this file we can fins a small introduction to NLP and an example of Bag Of Words representation.

### [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
The task in this file is to analyze sentiment in movies reviews. 

### [A Play Generator](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/NLP_Play_Generator.ipynb)
In this file a RNN model to generate text was created and trained on Romeo and  Juliet play.

## [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Reinforcement_Learning.ipynb)
In this file we have a simple introduction to Reinforcement Learning with a simple example about Q-learning technique.

## [Certificate Projects](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/Certificate%20Projects)

### [Cats and Dogs Classification](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Certificate%20Projects/Classification_cat_dog.ipynb)
The task of this project is to creat a CNN to classify dogs and cats images using a small dataset. To overcome these obtacles I have applied Data Augmentation and used a pretrained VGG net as the base of the classification mode.

### [Book Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Certificate%20Projects/Book_Recommendation_knn.ipynb)
The task is to develop a Book Recommendation Engine using KNN algorithm and a dataset that contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
