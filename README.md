#### [Introduction to Tensorflow](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Introduction_to_Tensorflow.ipynb)
In this file there is a simple introduction to Tensorflow. Introduction to tensors their properties and basic operation to be applied on them.


#### [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Linear_Regression.ipynb)
In this task we use Titanic dataset to find the likelhood of a person to survive giving some inforamtion about them.

#### [Classification](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Classification.ipynb)
In this task we use Iris Flower dataset to predict the species of a flower giving some details about it.

#### [Clustering](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Clustering.ipynb)
In this file we can find a simple explination about Clustering and K-Means algorithm.

#### [Hidden Markov Models](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/main/Hidden_Markov_Models.ipynb)
In this file, Hidden Markov Models are simply explained and then an example was developed.
The task was to build a weather model that can predict the weather on any given day, given the probability of different events occuring.
